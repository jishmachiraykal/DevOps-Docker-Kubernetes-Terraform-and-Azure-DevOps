* Group of servers managed together and connected to the cluster

* Multiple instances can be launched using single command and load is balanced

* If one of the instances go down, kubernetes makes other instances running. And also it is possible to switch between multiple releases

* Kubernetes is cloud neutral. Google, Azure and AWS have their own kubernetes to manage

* To manage these clusters we use, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE): https://cloud.google.com/

* Kubernetes manages servers(virtual servers) which are in cloud. These virtual servers are called by different names in clouds
    AWS: Elastic compute cloud(EC2)
    Azure: Virtual machines
    Google: compute machines
    Kubernetes: nodes

* Cluster is combination of nodes and master nodes. Nodes does the work and master nodes manages everything

* K8S stands for Kubernetes = K8(ubernete)S = 8 middle letters = KOO-BER-NET-EZ(Pronunciation)

* Kubernetes on cloud: Azure(AKS), AWS( Amazon AKS) and Google(GKE)
